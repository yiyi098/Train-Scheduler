# Train-Scheduler

### Overview

We created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This website (setup on Github) will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

### Instructions
  
* When adding trains, administrators are able to submit the following:

  * Train Name

  * Destination 

  * First Train Time -- in military time

  * Frequency -- in minutes
